        <item>"Are you going to a town hall or to another public institution's office? In many cases, you must show your passport or driver's license. That's how the government knows who you are. On the internet you can digitally identify yourself by using your DigiD. With your DigiD you can log in to government and healthcare websites."</item>
        <item>Your DigiD consists of a username and password that you both choose yourself. Please note: username and password are strictly personal. Keep this information safe and prevent misuse. No-one may ask you for your username, password or activation code. Not by email, phone or any way.</item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>How does DigiD work?</b>]]></item>
        <item>Imagine you want to apply for a rent allowance on the Tax Administration site. You will then be automatically forwarded to the DigiD login page from the Tax Office. You enter your DigiD username and password. Then you automatically return to the Tax Administration site, where you can apply for the rent allowance.</item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>How to get a DigiD?</b>]]></item>
        <item>"You can apply for a DigiD on the internet, with the help of a Dutch assistant. When you create your DigiD, you can choose a username. As mentioned above it is important to keep this information safe and secure. Once the application has been processed, you will receive a letter containing your DigiD password. Your DigiD must be activated within 14 days. It is therefore important to archive this letter (don't throw it away!) and activate the DigiD as soon as possible.â€‹"</item>

        <item>All Dutch banks require that you live in the Netherlands and are subscribed to the GBA, Gemeentelijke Basis Administratie (Municipal Basic Administration). You are also required to have a Dutch identification or residence permit. Without these it will be impossible to request a bank account.</item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>Extra options for residents from other EU member states</b>]]></item>
        <item>People who originate from other EU member state have extra options. Dutch banks have to treat residents from other EU member states in the same fashion as residents from their own country. If the bank denies your request due to your nationality, you can object at the bank. If escalation is necessary the next step is filing a complaint at the European extrajudicial complaints network for financial services.</item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>Applying for a bank account</b>]]></item>
        <item>If you do comply with above requirements you can often request a payments account online at the different Dutch banks or by visiting their offices. On top of the savings account you can also use other financial services like requesting a creditcard. In the following overview you can see which banks in the Netherlands offer payments accounts and how much they charge for their services:</item>
